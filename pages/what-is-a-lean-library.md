title: What is a Lean Library?
next: pull-vs-push-for-library-services

A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
in whole or in part, lean principles, strategies, and techniques by 
responding to our patrons desires and demands for resources and services 
with quick, iterative project planning and implementation. In this topic, we
will first look at the origins of **Lean**  through Lean Manufacturing followed
by Lean Startup management approach to technology products and services
development and deployment. With this rich source of techniques and tools, 
the library becomes a lean and efficient source of knowledge creation, access, and 
management as a lean learning library.

## The Origin of Lean
Originally based on the ideas and principles of Japanese
[Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) management
philosophy, the idea of **Lean** was later expanded and adapted by the 
[Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement for delivering
technology products in a faster, more responsive manner by software-based 
start-up companies. The ideas behind Lean are now part of the operations in
organizations of all types and sizes including schools, universities, non-profits and 
even governmental agencies. 

### Lean Manufacturing and Toyota Production System
Lean Manufacturing originated with the Japanese automobile company Toyota
with their initial development and promotion in the 1950s and 1960s of what became known as 
the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System)
or **TPQ**.  TPQ 
introduced Kanban and other just-in-time techniques that together minimizing 
waste and size of material inventories when manufacturing products, in the case of 
Toyota, automobiles. Improvements in mechanical and information
efficiency increased the quality of the end product, while reducing costs 
of the manufacturing and delivering the product to the intermediate or end customer. 
Accomplished through coordinated
vertical and horizontal demand driven agreements and contracts between 
the many different parties involved in the supply chain of modern, global manufacturing
of complex products. 

Libraries traditional do not produce or manufacture products, 
although the addition of 3-D printing to public and academic libraries
surprisingly puts libraries into more of a manufacturing role. Libraries are 
becoming publishers of born digital text, audio, and video that is being
created by their communities through such technologies as digital repositories,
social networks, and web content management systems. 
More interestingly, is the growth and what I believe an important
opportunity for libraries in assisting their communities in capturing and 
preserving many of the data sets that are being created and consumed by the
governmental, commercial, and non-profit organizations in our communities. 
As we move into these new
roles, the experiences of lean manufacturing can help libraries maximize their
human and computing resources in providing, publishing, and producing both 
physical and digital objects.  

### Lean Startup
We now move from **Lean Manufacturing** to **Lean Startups**.

Many of the ideas and vocabulary surrounding lean startups originated 
from Eric Ries's 2011 book, *The Lean Startup* has become a standard way to communicate about
the projects and status of technology in the start-up and general open-source development worlds. 
For example, in a [recent announcement](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1706&L=CODE4LIB&F=&S=&P=51800) about ArcLight 
on the Code4Lib library technology email list, it
directly refers to to the "ArcLight MVP project team" made up of mostly
Stanford University employees. The **MVP** or 
minimum viable product, is a core concept we will explore more in the Build-Measure-Learn topic
in this presentation.


## Lean Learning Library
While the focus on my own research has been more on the bibliographic metadata and 
semantic web technology and technical services
workflow management, a core aspiration for applying **Lean** within your library
is more broadly improving the organizational knowledge and through reducing barriers in the 
information flow from the library's operations and collections to the library's staff and
patrons. In this context,
a "lean library" is a library that actively minimizes the sources of friction patrons 
may have in discovering and accessing the library's collections and services.
