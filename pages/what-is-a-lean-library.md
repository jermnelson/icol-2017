title: What is a Lean Library?
next: pull-vs-push-for-library-services

## Origin
Originally based on the ideas and principles of the 
[Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) management
philosophy and later expanded and adapted by the 
[Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement, a
Lean Library applies and modifies these principles to improve library services
and resource delivery by responding to our patrons desires and demands with 
quick, iterative project planning and implementation.

## Characteristics of Lean Organizations
*  Focus on upstream demand
*  Deliver services in responsive and timely manner
