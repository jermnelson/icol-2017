title: What is a Lean Library?
next: pull-vs-push-for-library-services

A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
in whole or in part, lean principles, strategies, and techniques by 
responding to our patrons desires and demands for resources and services 
with quick, iterative project planning and implementation. In this topic, we
will first look at the origins of **Lean**  through Lean Manufacturing followed
by Lean Startup management approach to technology products and services.
With this rich source of techniques and tools, 
the library becomes a center of knowledge creation, access, and 
management as a lean learning library.

### Lean Manufacturing and Toyota Production System
Lean Manufacturing originated with the Japanese automobile company Toyota
with their initial development and promotion in the 1950s and 1960s of what became known as 
the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System)
or **TPQ**.  TPQ 
introduced **Kanban** and other just-in-time techniques that together minimize 
waste and size of material inventories when manufacturing products, in the case of 
Toyota, automobiles. Improvements in mechanical and information
efficiency increased the quality of the end product, while reducing costs 
of the manufacturing and delivering the product to the intermediate or end customer. 

### Lean Startup
We now move from **Lean Manufacturing** to **Lean Startups**.

Many of the ideas and vocabulary surrounding lean startups originated 
from Eric Ries's 2011 book, *The Lean Startup* has become a standard way to communicate about
the projects and status of technology in the start-up and general open-source development worlds. 
For example, in a [recent announcement](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1706&L=CODE4LIB&F=&S=&P=51800) about ArcLight 
on the Code4Lib library technology email list, it
directly refers to to the "ArcLight MVP project team" made up of mostly
Stanford University employees. The **MVP** or 
minimum viable product, is a core concept we will explore more in the Build-Measure-Learn topic.


## Lean Learning Library
Libraries traditional do not produce or manufacture products, 
although the addition of 3-D printing to public and academic libraries
surprisingly puts libraries into more of a manufacturing role. Libraries are 
becoming publishers of born digital text, audio, and video that is being
created by their communities through such technologies as digital repositories,
social networks, and web content management systems. 
More interestingly, is the 
opportunity for libraries in capturing and 
preserving many of the data sets that are being created and consumed by the
governmental, commercial, and non-profit organizations in our communities. 

A core aspiration for applying **Lean** within your library
is more broadly improving the organizational knowledge and through reducing barriers in the 
information flow from the library's operations and collections to the library's staff and
patrons. In this context,
a "lean library" is a library that actively monitors the sources of friction patrons 
may have in discovering and accessing the library's collections and services and then develops
services and resources in response to this new information.
