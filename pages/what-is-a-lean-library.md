title: What is a Lean Library?
next: pull-vs-push-for-library-services


## Origin
Originally based on the ideas and principles of Japanese
[Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) management
philosophy, was later expanded and adapted by the 
[Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement that has expanded
to organizations of all types and sizes including non-profits and governmental agencies. 
What is a Lean Library? A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
lean principles, strategies, and techniques for responding to 
patron demands for services and resources. My conception of a Lean 
Library is built upon the principles Eric Ries writes in his book 
[Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book)


## Lean Manufacturing and Toyota Production System
Lean Manufacturing originated with the Japanese automobile company Toyota
with their initial adoption in the 1950s and 1960s of what became know as 
the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System)
or **TPQ**.   
introduced Kanban and other just-in-time techniques that together minimizing 
waste and size of material inventories when manufacturing products, in the case of 
Toyota, cars. Improvements in mechanical and information
efficiency increased quality the quality of the end product, while reducing costs 
of the manufacturing and delivering a product to the customer. Accomplished
through coordinated
vertical and horizontal demand driven agreements and contracts between 
the many different parties involved in the modern, global manufacturing
of complex products. 

Libraries traditional do not produce or manufacturing products 
(although the addition of 3-D printing to public and academic libraries
surprising puts libraries into more of a manufacturing role).

## Lean Library
From this literature, I want to first highlight what I think is the 
critical insight from Lean Startups and Lean Manufacturing which is 
the difference between what is the still dominate form of industrial
and corporate structures base upon researching and then marketing specific
products that are **Push**ed to customers.


A Lean Library applies and modifies these principles in an effort improve library services
and resource delivery by responding to our patrons desires and demands with 
quick, iterative project planning and implementation.


## Characteristics of Lean Organizations
*  Focus on upstream demand, what is referred to as *pull*
*  Deliver services in responsive and timely manner
