title: What is a Lean Library?
next: pull-vs-push-for-library-services

## Origin
Originally based on the ideas and principles of the 
[Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing) management
philosophy and later expanded and adapted by the 
[Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) movement, a
Lean Library applies and modifies these principles in an effort improve library services
and resource delivery by responding to our patrons desires and demands with 
quick, iterative project planning and implementation.

What is a Lean Library? A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
lean principles, strategies, and techniques for responding to 
patron demands for services and resources. My conception of a Lean 
Library is built upon the principles Eric Ries writes in his book 
[Lean Startup]()

## Characteristics of Lean Organizations
*  Focus on upstream demand, what is referred to as *pull*
*  Deliver services in responsive and timely manner
