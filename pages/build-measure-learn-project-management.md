Drawing upon the AGLE software development life-cycles and from Lean Manufacturing 
processes, Eric Ries, the originator of the Lean Startup, proposed a new model 
for fast, iterative technological development of software products and services in
what he calls a BML loop, short for **Build** - **Measure** - **Learn**. The initial
goal of the first BML loop is in the release of what he calls a Minimum Viable Product or
MVP.

The start of a technology project for a new library service or resource starts
**Build** phase, where taking the requirements driven by three 
main sources of pull, People, Organizations, and what I believe is becoming 
increasing important, algorithmic sources.  

From these requirements a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is built for initial 
use by your sources of pull
A library MVP should deliver an improvement in the resource access or service
by patrons or in the operational work-flow for managing the
resource or service by the library's staff.

## Measure
The next step in the loop is **Measure**, identifying key metrics 
from which you prepare you for the final step in the project development lifecycle.
