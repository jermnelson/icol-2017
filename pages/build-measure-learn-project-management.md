title: Build-Measure-Learn Project Management
previous: pull-vs-push-for-library-services

Drawing upon the AGLE software development life-cycles and from Lean Manufacturing 
processes, Eric Ries, the originator of the Lean Startup management movement, proposed a new model 
for fast, iterative technological development of software products and services in
what he calls a BML loop, short for three project phases 
**Build** - **Measure** - **Learn**. 

## Build
The start of a technology project for a new library service or resource starts in 
**Build** phase, where taking the requirements driven by three 
main sources of pull; People, Institutions, and what I believe is becoming 
increasing important, algorithmic sources of pull.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
From these requirements,  a 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is built for initial use by your sources of pull by 
creating one or more testable **hypotheses** that you think the project will improve or change. 
The purpose
of an **MVP** is to only build the least amount of functionality and user interface design
to meet but not exceed these requirements and hypothesis and to generate usage statistics and impressions
by the people and institutions that are the sources of pull for the project.

A library **MVP** should deliver an improvement in the resource access or service
by patrons or in the operational work-flow for managing the
resource or service by the library's staff. As your patrons and staff use the **MVP**,
you move into the second **Measure** phase of the BML loop.


## Measure
The next step in the loop is **Measure**, identifying key metrics 
from which you prepare for the final step in the project development lifecycle.
These metrics and measurements allow you to test the **hypotheses** generated in the **Build** phase.

One method of doing this is using **A/B** testing of User Interface elements where you 
randomly give half of your users one version of the user interface, and a variant of the user interface
to the other half. You then measure to then see what design preforms better to test your 
hypotheses that you created in the **Build** phase.

One area that you may not think of using the BML Loop is in the evaluation of commercial
library systems, services, or products. As the **Build** portion is typically completed (likely through
a **push** process) by the vendor, you can usually schedule a trial period that you can then turn into
a **Measure** phase where you gather usage statistics and impressions by sources of pull
before moving the **Learn** phase.

### Look out for Vanity Metrics
When deciding what metrics or measures to track, be careful of **Vanity** metrics
that's value seems to indicate improvement but the underlying process has not changed
in the direction you would like from hypotheses. For example, don't confuse click rates
on an instruction web resource to indicate learning of the topic, especially if the average
time being spent on the webpage is measured in seconds but would count as a click.


In the **Measure** phase, capturing and acknowledging the participation of your
end users of the software service or resource is important for the evaluation
that starts here but continues in full force in the final phase of BML Loop, the
**Learn** phase.

## Learn
Taking the key metrics gathered in the previous step, the <strong>Learn</strong>
