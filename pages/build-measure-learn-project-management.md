Drawing upon the AGLE software development life-cycles and from Lean Manufacturing 
processes, Eric Ries, the originator of the Lean Startup, proposed a new model 
for fast, iterative technological development of software products and services in
what he calls a BML loop, short for **Build** - **Measure** - **Learn**. The initial
goal of the first BML loop is in the release of what he calls a Minimum Viable Product or
MVP.
