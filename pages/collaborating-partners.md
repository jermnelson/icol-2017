title: Collaborating with Partners
previous: starting-lean-locally


With most libraries operating in a resource and money restrictive environment,
libraries can deliver new services and resources and improve existing ones 
through the application of **Lean** principles in both formal
and informal partnerships. By teaming up with each other and other non-profit 
and corporate organizations, we maximize and multiple our impact and improve
service and resource access across many more communities.

A critical part of the [Catalog Pull Platform]() is [BIBCAT](), a project originally
sponsored by the Library of Congress, that applies Linked Data processes to Library
Bibliographic data structured in multiple formats. I am using BIBCAT in two 
projects that involve multiple types and sizes of organizations.

## Alliance BIBCAT Project [bibcat.coalliance.org](http://bibcat.coalliance.org)
This project is sponsored by the Library Consortium, **Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries**,
with the intention of publishing the consortium's member libraries catalogs as RDF Linked Data for harvesting
by search engines.
 
Using selected MARC records from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/), 
[University of Colorado Boulder](), and the most recent partner, [SUNY Buffalo]() were all initially
generated from the Alliance's Gold Rush comparison 
service and the Library of Congress [marc2bibframe2](https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2)
project, these MARC records were converted into BIBFRAME 2.0 RDF and stored in a RDF triplestore. 
The RDF Linked Library data is
published to the web as Schema.org JSON-LD for indexing by Google, Bing, and other search engines. 

We are currently in the **Build** phase in our second BML Loop for this project with a 
projected release later this month.

## [Plains2Peaks.org](https://plains2peaks.org) DP.LA Regional Service Hub

The [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la) is a national non-profit that 
aggregates digital content from across the United States through a hub system
that distributes harvesting to regional libraries, consortium, museums, or other non-profit
organizations.

This project is A [State Library of Colorado]() sponsored effort to aggregate the metadata from across 
different libraries and museums in Colorado and Wyoming and provide a JSON-LD DPLA 
Map v4 feed to DP.LA to be included in the main DP.LA search portal.

We are currently in the **Build** phase in the first BML Loop for this project.
