A common misconception when comes to applying Lean principles and ideas in an
organization and in our particular case, libraries, is that in order to start
seeing benefits the entire library must adopt all of these ideas by restructure
all of its existing organizational structures, departments, and reporting lines.

I personally believe we have an increasingly important role as a respected authority regarding
the local intellectual and scholarly of creative works. Books, blog posts,
social network postings, photos and video that is being consumed and produced by 
our communities. This history of what is happening preserving this point of the use

## Library Systems and Technology

    What tools are available to allow libraries to respond to the specific demands
    of their patrons? 

Our current catalogs and collections represent more than just physical or digital
objects but a rich source of relationships and information that although this
is currently and overwhelming encoding as MARC or other variants across the 
world. The theory and practice of lean libraries has driven a very iterative 
development cycle in my own research and work towards unlocking and expanding
this knowledge in our current library catalogs into the form of Linked Data.

Linked data is a way to structure information more consumable and  with
other systems.


While it is great if the library administration wants to a radical Lean make-over
of the library, you can start seeing more modest improvements by applying as much
or as little of these lean ideas in your technology projects and services. To 
illustrate this idea, I will draw from my example of iteratively developing an
web application for Colorado College's Seniors to self-submit their thesis and
any accompanying datasets, audio, or video to Colorado College's [digital repository][DIGITALCC]
as a permanent, stable intellectual property of the college and the student.
