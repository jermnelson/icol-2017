title: Starting Lean Locally

A common misconception when comes to applying Lean principles and ideas in an
organization and in our particular case, libraries, is that in order to start
seeing benefits the entire library must adopt all of these ideas by restructure
all of its existing organizational structures, departments, and reporting lines.

While it is great if the library administration wants to a radical Lean make-over
of the library, you can start seeing more modest improvements by applying as much
or as little of these lean ideas in your technology projects and services. To 
illustrate this idea, I will draw from my example of iteratively developing an
web application for Colorado College's Seniors to self-submit their thesis and
any accompanying datasets, audio, or video to Colorado College's [digital repository][DIGITALCC]
as a permanent, stable intellectual property of the college and the student.
