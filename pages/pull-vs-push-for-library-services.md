What makes **Lean** different is the basic understanding 
about the consumer demand for a product or service and how to respond
accordingly.

## Traditional "Push" Organization 
With it's origins in early modern industrial companies (The Ford Motor Company 
being the exemplar of this early type of organization) **Push** is about the ability of 
large corporations and organizations to accurately predict and mold demand of 
customers and then organize their operations around those predictions in order to sell those
products. 

Here is a highly stylized automotive manufacturing assembly line
to illustrate the traditional **Push**-based factory:

## Pull and Lean
**Pull** identifies and responds to needs and demands for an organization's products 
and services by "pulling" directly from the customers and potential 
customers. In a reversal of **Push**,
the Lean organization starts with the end customer and using **Kanban** scheduling system 
for later steps in the 
assembly line to signal an early step for material. Nothing is manufactured or produced
unless a **Red Kanban Card** is indicated by the next step in the assembly line.  

We now use the same three steps in the **Push** example to show how **Pull** processes
are different.
