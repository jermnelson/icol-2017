## Push 
With it's origins in early modern industrial companies, with the Ford Motor Company 
being the exemplar of this type of organization, **Push** is about the ability of 
large companies and organizations to accurately predict and mold demand of 
customers, organize their operations around those predictions, and then sell those
products based upon the organization's predictions and planning. 


## Pull
Based upon Toyota Motor Company's [Lean Manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing)
 principles and ideas, **Pull** identifies and responds to needs and demands for organization products 
and services by "pulling" directly from the organizations customers and potential 
customers.
