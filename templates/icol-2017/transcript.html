        Hello and greetings from Colorado Springs, Colorado in the United States. 
        Thank-you for this incredible honor
        and privilege to speak with you today at the 2017 International
        Conference on Libraries. My name is 
        <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Jeremy Nelson</a> and I am 
        an academic librarian at Colorado College and
        I am co-founder and CTO 
        of a semantic web start-up <a href="http://knowledgelinks.io">company</a>, 
        I am also the author of <a href="http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/">
        <em>Becoming a Lean Library</em></a> published in 2016 by Chandos Publishing.
        I have been applying and 
        experimenting with Lean Start-up concepts and principles within
        my local library and through larger projects with other academic libraries,
        <a href="https://coalliance.org/">library consortium</a>,
        <a href="http://denverpublic.org/">public libraries</a>, museums and even the 
        <a href="https://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a>.

        This talk is divided into multiple and related topics centering around lean ideas
        and their applications. First, we will briefly cover the
        history of "lean" with it's start in the manufacturing sector in Japan
        and then later to more technology products in Silicon Valley with Lean Startup movement.
        We'll go over the 
        conceptual differences between the traditional
        <strong>Push</strong> processes in manufacturing and organizational structures into what is a core
        concept behind lean,  building services and products that 
        <strong>Pull</strong>
        the requirements directly from intermediate and final customers, or in our case as 
        libraries, our patrons. 
    </p> 
    <p>   
        After understanding <strong>Pull</strong> at a high level,
        we'll switch to a more practical focus as we go over
        my experiences developing a <a href="#">Catalog Pull Platform</a> based upon Library
        Linked Data that uses 
        Lean Startup project management techniques. These Lean Startups techniques center around
        iterative and fast project development loops. Each loop is made up of
        three parts, a <strong>Build</strong> phase where a <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>
        is created or expanded upon, a <strong>Measure</strong> phase where the MVP is tested with your patrons
        or staff and a <strong>Learn</strong> phase that takes what you measured and your experiences to
        grow you and your library's knowledge and make a decision on what to do next. Your metrics may indicate
        that the project should be abandoned, that project would start the next BML loop, or the project could 
        <strong>pivot</strong>
        due to technology change in library or general computing or personnel changes in your organization. 
        Finally I'll discuss applying lean principles in 
        developing library technology for 
        my local academic library as well as expanding to collaborative projects with other 
        libraries and organizations at regional and national levels.

        Before I go further; there is an accompanying website at 
        <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/icol-2017</a> 
        with the slides from this talks, links to resources, and a video transcript.
        In this first topic, I will switch over to a screen-cast view.

    In the next topic screen-cast, we will and compare and contrast <strong>Push</strong> processes verses 
    <strong>Pull</strong> based approaches favored by lean manufactures and lean startups.

    <p>
        Thank-you for giving me your time and attention today as we briefly went over <strong>Lean</strong>
        concepts and applications to libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
        I personally believe libraries have an increasingly important role as a respected authority regarding
        the local intellectual and scholarly output of our communities creative works like books, blog posts,
        social network postings, photos, music, and videos. Through the application of <strong>Lean</strong> we can now become the 
        authority on local knowledge and the curator of the creativity of the people we service in our 
        communities.
