        Before I go further; there is an accompanying website at

        This video is divided into three sections. First we briefly 
        go over the core concepts behind the Lean Startup management
        philosophy with its roots in the Japanese Lean Manufacturing that
        introduced Kanban and other just-in-time techniques for minimizing 
        waste in material inventories and through improvements in mechanical 
        efficiency are able to improve the quality while reducing costs of the 
        manufacturing and delivering a product to the customer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we will look out how to start applying Lean 
        principles locally in your own library. The final third will be on
        collaborating with other libraries and organizations, using Lean 
        concepts, improves outcomes for our patrons and communities.

            What is a Lean Library? A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
            lean principles, strategies, and techniques for responding to 
            patron demands for services and resources. My conception of a Lean 
            Library is built upon the principles Eric Ries writes in his book

       From this literature, I want to first highlight what I think is the 
       critical insight from Lean Startups and Lean Manufacturing which is 
       the difference between what is the still dominate form of industrial
       and corporate structeds base upon researching and then marketing specific
       products that are <strong>Push</strong>ed to customers.
