        Before I go further; there is an accompanying website at 
        <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/icol2017</a> 
        with the slides from this talks, links to resources, and a video transcript.

        This video is divided into three sections. First we briefly 
        go over the core concepts behind the Lean Startup management
        philosophy with its roots in the Japanese Kanban and Just-in-time
        techniques. Next, we will look out how to start applying Lean 
        principles locally in your own library. The final third will be on
        collaborating with other libraries and organizations, using Lean 
        concepts, improves outcomes for our patrons and communities.
    </p>
