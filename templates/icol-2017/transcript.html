        Hello! How are all of you today? Thank-you for the honor
        and privilege of speaking with you. My name is 
        <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Jeremy Nelson</a> and I am 
        the academic librarian in Colorado, USA..
        I am also  co-founder and CTO 
        of a semantic web start-up <a href="http://knowledgelinks.io">company</a> 
        I author of <a href="http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/">
        <em>Becoming a Lean Library</em></a>, I have been applying and 
        experimenting with Lean Start-up concepts and principles within
        my local library and through larger projects with other libraries,
        <a href="https://coalliance.org/">library consortium</a>,
        <a href="http://denverpublic.org/">public libraries</a>, museums and even the 
        <a href="https://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a>.

        Before I go further; there is an accompanying website at 
        <a href="{{ url_for('home') }}">http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/icol2017</a> 
        with the slides from this talks, links to resources, and a video transcript.

    <p>
        This talk is divided into three sections. First, we briefly 
        go over a couple of core concepts behind the Lean Startup management
        philosophy with its roots in the Japanese Lean Manufacturing. Lean Manufacturing 
        introduced Kanban and other just-in-time techniques that together minimizing 
        waste and size of material inventories when manufacturing, in the case of 
        Toyota, cars. Improvements in mechanical 
        efficiency increase quality while reducing costs of the 
        manufacturing and delivering a product to the customer through coordinated
        vertical and horizontal demand driven agreements and contracts between 
        the many different parties involved in the modern, global manufacturing
        of complex products. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Libraries traditional do not produce or manufacturing products 
        (although the addition of 3-D printing to public and academic libraries
         surprising puts libraries into more of a manufacturing role) but I personally
        believe we have an increasing important role as a respected authority regarding
        the local intellectual and scholarly of creative works including books, blog posts,
        social network postings, photos and video that is being consumed and produced by 
        our communities.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Our current catalogs and collections represent more than just physical or digital
        objects but a rich source of relationships and information that although this
        is currently and overwhelming encoding as MARC or other variants across the 
        world. The theory and practice of lean libraries has driven a very iterative 
        development cycle in my own research and work towards unlocking and expanding
        this knowledge in our current library catalogs into the form of Linked Data.

    <p>
        What tools are available to allow libraries to respond to the specific demands
        of their patrons? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, we will look out how to start applying Lean 
        principles locally in your own library. The final third will be on
        collaborating with other libraries and organizations, using Lean 
        concepts, to improves outcomes for our patrons and communities.

            What is a Lean Library? A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
            lean principles, strategies, and techniques for responding to 
            patron demands for services and resources. My conception of a Lean 
            Library is built upon the principles Eric Ries writes in his book

    <p>
       From this literature, I want to first highlight what I think is the 
       critical insight from Lean Startups and Lean Manufacturing which is 
       the difference between what is the still dominate form of industrial
       and corporate structures base upon researching and then marketing specific
       products that are <strong>Push</strong>ed to customers.

    <p>
        The start of a technology project for a new library service or resource starts
        <strong>Build</strong> step, where taking the requirements driven by three 
        main sources of pull, People, Organizations, and what I believe is becoming 
        increasing important, algorithmic sources. From these requirements a 
        Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is built for initial use by your sources of pull.
        A library MVP should deliver an improvement in the resource access or work-flow
        for managing the resource by the library's staff.
    </p>
    
    <p>  
        The next step in the loop is <strong>Measure</strong>, identifying key metrics 
        from which you prepare you for the final step in the project development lifecycle.
