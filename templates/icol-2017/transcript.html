        Hello and greetings from Colorado Springs, Colorado in the United States. 
        Thank-you for this incredible honor
        and privilege for this invitation to speak with you. My name is 
        <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}">Jeremy Nelson</a> and I am 
        an academic librarian at Colorado College and
        I am co-founder and CTO 
        of a semantic web start-up <a href="http://knowledgelinks.io">company</a>, 
        I am the author of <a href="http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/">
        <em>Becoming a Lean Library</em></a> published in 2016 by Chandos Publishing.
        I have been applying and 
        experimenting with Lean Start-up concepts and principles within
        my local library and through larger projects with other libraries,
        <a href="https://coalliance.org/">library consortium</a>,
        <a href="http://denverpublic.org/">public libraries</a>, museums and even the 
        <a href="https://loc.gov">Library of Congress</a>.

        This talk is divided into multiple and related topics centering around lean ideas
        and their applications. First, we will briefly cover the
        history of "lean" with it's start in the manufacturing sector in Japan
        and then later to more technology products in Silicon Valley with Lean Startup.
        We'll go over the 
        conceptual differences between the traditional
        <strong>Push</strong> manufacturing and organizations into what is a core
        concept behind lean,  building services and products that 
        <strong>Pull</strong>
        the requirements directly from intermediate and final customers, or in our case as 
        libraries, our patrons. 
    </p> 
    <p>   
        After understanding <strong>Pull</strong> at a high level,
        we'll switch to a more practical focus as we go over
        my experiences developing a <a href="#">Catalog Pull Platform</a> based upon Library
        Linked Data that uses 
        Lean Startup project management techniques. These Lean Startups techniques center around
        iterative and fast project development loops. Each loop is made up of
        three parts, a <strong>Build</strong> phase where a <strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong>
        is created or expanded upon, a <strong>Measure</strong> phase where the MVP is tested with your patrons
        or staff and a <strong>Learn</strong> phase that takes what you measured and your experiences to
        grow you and your library's knowledge and to prepare for the next BML loop. 
        Finally I'll discuss applying lean principles in 
        developing library technology for 
        my local academic library as well as expanding to collaborative projects with other 
        libraries and organizations at regional and national levels.

        With its roots in the Japanese Lean Manufacturing. Lean Manufacturing 
        introduced Kanban and other just-in-time techniques that together minimizing 
        waste and size of material inventories when manufacturing products, in the case of 
        Toyota, cars. Improvements in mechanical and information
        efficiency increased quality the quality of the end product, while reducing costs 
        of the manufacturing and delivering a product to the customer. Accomplished
        through coordinated
        vertical and horizontal demand driven agreements and contracts between 
        the many different parties involved in the modern, global manufacturing
        of complex products.

        Libraries traditional do not produce or manufacturing products 
        (although the addition of 3-D printing to public and academic libraries
         surprising puts libraries into more of a manufacturing role) but I personally
        believe we have an increasingly important role as a respected authority regarding
        the local intellectual and scholarly of creative works. Books, blog posts,
        social network postings, photos and video that is being consumed and produced by 
        our communities. This history of what is happening preserving this point of the use

    Librarians have a things

        Our current catalogs and collections represent more than just physical or digital
        objects but a rich source of relationships and information that although this
        is currently and overwhelming encoding as MARC or other variants across the 
        world. The theory and practice of lean libraries has driven a very iterative 
        development cycle in my own research and work towards unlocking and expanding
        this knowledge in our current library catalogs into the form of Linked Data.
        Linked data is a way to structure information more consumable and interoablity with
        other systems.

        What tools are available to allow libraries to respond to the specific demands
        of their patrons?

            What is a Lean Library? A Lean Library is a library that adopts 
            lean principles, strategies, and techniques for responding to 
            patron demands for services and resources. My conception of a Lean 
            Library is built upon the principles Eric Ries writes in his book

       From this literature, I want to first highlight what I think is the 
       critical insight from Lean Startups and Lean Manufacturing which is 
       the difference between what is the still dominate form of industrial
       and corporate structures base upon researching and then marketing specific
       products that are <strong>Push</strong>ed to customers.

    TRANSITION SUCKS!!!!

    <p>
        The start of a technology project for a new library service or resource starts
        <strong>Build</strong> step, where taking the requirements driven by three 
        main sources of pull, People, Organizations, and what I believe is becoming 
        increasing important, algorithmic sources. From these requirements a 
        Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is built for initial use by your sources of pull.
        A library MVP should deliver an improvement in the resource access or work-flow
        for managing the resource by the library's staff.

        The next step in the loop is <strong>Measure</strong>, identifying key metrics 
        from which you prepare you for the final step in the project development lifecycle.
        Tracking and used in the nextpahse
